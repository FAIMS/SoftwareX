               research results for scientific and public uses and empower
               novel research applications. Access to data, samples, methods,
               and reagents used to conduct research and analysis, as well as
               to the code used to analyze and process data and samples, is a
               fundamental requirement for transparency and reproducibility.
               The field sciences (e.g., geology, ecology, and archaeology),
               where each study is temporally (and often spatially) unique,
               provide exemplars for the importance of preserving data and
               samples for further analysis. Yet field sciences, if they even
               address such access, commonly do so by simply noting ``data and
               samples available upon request.'' They lag behind some
               laboratory sciences in making data and samples available to the
               broader research community. It is time for this to change. We
               discuss cultural, financial, and technical barriers to change
               and ways in which funders, publishers, scientific societies, and
